    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Ranch dressing</li>
        <li>4 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 small avocado - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with cooking spray. Brush both sides of each chicken breast with barbeque sauce and place in the baking dish. Top each breast with 2 slices bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until juices run clear. Drain bacon strips on paper towels, and slice breasts in half lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven broiler. Spread both halves of each hoagie roll with Ranch dressing. Place 2 breast halves on one half of each roll. Place 2 strips of bacon on each remaining roll half. Top each half with 1 slice Swiss cheese.</li>
        <li>Arrange sandwich halves on the baking sheet, and broil 2 to 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Layer chicken halves of sandwiches with avocado slices, and top with bacon halves to serve.</li>
