    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>Cut down on oil by making "fried" chicken in the oven. This oven-fried chicken recipe, made with simple ingredients you probably already have on hand, is as good as it gets.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: This recipe calls for 12 chicken thighs, but you could also use breasts, legs, wings, or drumsticks.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds crispness, seals in moisture, and encourages browning.</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs: You can use store-bought Italian-seasoned bread crumbs or make your own at home.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Whole eggs add moisture and give the flour and bread crumbs something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This oven-fried chicken is simply seasoned with salt and pepper, plus a little paprika for subtle heat and smoky flavor.</li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable oil keeps the chicken moist and juicy. Canola oil or olive oil would also work well for this recipe.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat eggs in another bowl.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, until all pieces are coated.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs and sprinkle with paprika to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
